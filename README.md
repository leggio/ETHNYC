# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node --> run chain locally
npx hardhat test --> run solidity tests
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js --> deploy contract to local chain (do this in a second terminal while npx hardhat node is still running)
```
