Commands:

```shell
npx hardhat node --> run chain locally
npx hardhat test --> run solidity tests
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js --> deploy contract to local chain (do this in a second terminal while npx hardhat node is still running)
```

To run the react app successfully you will need to do it in a new terminal window with `npx hardhat node` already running.
